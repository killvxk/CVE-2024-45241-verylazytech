# CVE-2024-45241: Path Traversal in CentralSquare's CryWolf

## Vulnerability Overview

CVE Identifier: CVE-2024-45241

Product: CentralSquare CryWolf (False Alarm Management)

Affected Component: GeneralDocs.aspx

Vulnerability Type: Path Traversal

Discovery Date: 2024-08-09

## Description
A path traversal vulnerability has been identified in the GeneralDocs.aspx component of CentralSquare CryWolf, a False Alarm Management system. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit the rpt parameter to access files outside of the intended web directory. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

## Technical Details
### Path Traversal Vulnerability:

Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when an application allows users to manipulate file paths in a way that allows them to access files and directories outside the intended directory. This is often achieved by using sequences like ../ (dot-dot-slash) to traverse directories.

### Affected Component:

In this case, the affected component is GeneralDocs.aspx. This ASP.NET page appears to handle document requests or generation based on parameters provided by the user.

### Parameter in Question:

The rpt parameter is used to specify which document or report should be processed or retrieved. The vulnerability arises because this parameter is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing attackers to manipulate it to traverse directories.

### Exploitation:

#### Finding Targets

To find potential targets, use Fofa (similar to Shodan.io):

- **Fofa Dork**: "Powered by CryWolf"
